# Image Coursel: Cookies
This is a basic and simple project with React that doesn't require the use of third-party libraries. What I love about this is that you don't need a lot of code and special libraries to start building this carousel. 

# About
A user will be able to more forward and backwards through the photos by clicking ont eh arrows left and right. The images are stored in an array and we will see how to use state in orer ot store the current image. State will be updated to go to the previous or next image base don teh button the user pressed. The coursel also allows the user to continue clicking through the photos after all the photos have been seen.
